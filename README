SEB - SliTaz Embedded OS
================================================================================

Back to the root with this cmdline tool to build realy small SliTaz textmode 
system for hacking, learning and developing small Linux operating system.

Seb builder will init a minimal set of files that you can customise at your
needs, install Busybox and create a compressed rootfs that can boot in frugal
mode as well as an ISO image to use with Qemu. Other boot methods can be used
with a bit a knowledge (web boot). The system is built in a single rootfs
folder wich can be used as chroot environment.

SliTaz embedded provide all basic Linux command, a powerfull web server with
CGI support and a set of home made tools for administration and debuging. Seb
is easy too use, follow the KISS principle. Please use SliTaz Bugs System
for any bug report. There is no wifi support and it's not bug :-)

If you want to learn more about the basics of a Linux operating system you
can have a look to SliTaz Scratchbook wich explain step by step the creation of
SliTaz back in 2006. This tool was published in 2017, ten years after the first
cooking public release :-)

Seb system will fit into a ~4MB ISO image for the realy base system, up to 10Mb
or more, but without X. If you are seraching for an even more small SliTaz 
version, please have a look to Tiny SliTaz: http://tiny.slitaz.org


Goals and features
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Built fast and light servers or mediabox
  * Nice way to learn about creating Linux OS
  * Built small rescue systems in frugal mode
  * Fun playground for hackers and kids


Quickstart Guide:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build a distro in a few commands. Install seb or run it from source tree. After the
init command you can modify and add extra files in the embfs/ folder:

  # mkdir my-seb; cd my-seb
  # seb init
  # seb -p sqlite --add
  # seb build


Build process & environment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Seb is not compliling any tools, it will use Slitaz standard executable and
libraries - Seb-os is created on top of SliTaz. Packages installed in seb must
be on the build host, this is the case for the full basic sysem.

Seb will build the custom operating system into the current directory or it
will read a seb.conf file to know the path to the work/build folder. Seb will
use these directories to work:

  * rootfs/     The root filsysytem of the compressed operationg system
  * rootiso/    Root of the ISO image with rootfs.gz, bootloader and kernel
  * sebfs/      Custom files overwritting file into the rootfs
  * sebpkgs/    The packages to install into the distro


Frugal install
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A frugal installation let you boot your seb system without any installation and
with the all system running in memory. Basicaly you need to have the rootfs.gz
and the kernel in the /boot tree and a entry in Grub configuration file. SliTaz
provide a nifty little tools for frugal install:

  # frugal path/to/image.iso
  

Virtual disk
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A virtual disk let you have a persitstant filesystem when using Qemu or booting,
in frugal mode (recommended). It is useful when developping/debugging scripts 
that runs into a seb-os or to host web server virtual hosts. Create, mount or
umount disk:

  # seb disk


Source code and devel guidelines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note even need to say that this tool MUST stay simple, fast, elegant and fun.
We dont want a super tool for complex system building, we have tazlito and Tiny
SliTaz for that. Seb is as close as possible of SliTaz first build, seb is
also a learning tool. Seb let you build sandbox os and rock solid web server.

  * examples/       Various fs and scripts examples
  * initfs/         Initial files used to create the system
  * seb             SliTaz Embedded operation system builder
  * tools/          Various tools included or used to build an OS
  * packages/       SliTaz Embedded packages
  

Gettext i18n
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No i18n with gettext in seb tools since seb distro dont include gettext-base.
